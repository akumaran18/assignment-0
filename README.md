# Example: Dataframe Operations with Pandas and Numpy

In this example, a csv file of daily blood glucose values (365 values per unique member) is dimensionally flipped and stored in a numpy array. NaN values are replaced my the previous/next non-NaN value. Finally, the daily value averaged over all members is plotted over 365 days using matplotlib.
